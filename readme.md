# Idea behind DS_Hulk

This repository contains the code and problem solutions to many python problems. It also includes numpy and matplotlob exercises. 

It is ideal for people who tend to forget syntax, its content is taken from the AZ101 Python course which I completed, as part of my premium plan. 


References : AZ101 (Python) bootcamp [https://maang.in]

Most of the theory content is taken from this free course by Vivek Gupta taught on Algozenith. 
This repository contains the code, which I wrote while learning Python from this course, there is NO INTENT to copy/paste, many examples are my own and different from the website, while some are same as well. 


Kindly refer to this useful course, link given below, for any reference.
